# The Continuous Improvement Journey: How Data Science Complements the Six Sigma Methodology in Manufacturing 
 
Six Sigma is a proven, data-driven methodology for continuous improvement, and data science is a relatively new field with exciting potential. Together, both go hand in hand to help organizations search for truth in data to improve their processes. The use of data science in the manufacturing industry is redefining industrial precision when paired with Six Sigma.

Nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies have adopted the Six Sigma methodology for their organizations. The DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) improvement cycle is the core tool used to drive Six Sigma projects. By applying it, organizations are able to reduce variation and limit defect levels to less than 3.4 parts per million.

In this talk, we will introduce you to the fundamentals of combining Six Sigma with data science.

By the end of the talk, you will gain insights into how to incorporate your data science skills into Six Sigma projects.
